## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates how a **web-based keystroke logger** can be implemented using:

- **Go (Golang)** as the backend server
- **WebSockets** for real-time keystroke delivery
- **JavaScript** for browser-side event capture
- **HTML/CSS** for a realistic login form interface

It is designed to simulate a scenario for learning how client-side data can be captured and sent to a backend service.
